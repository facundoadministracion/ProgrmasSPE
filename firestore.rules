/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces an "Authenticated Read, Restricted Write" security model.
 * All authenticated users, including those signed in anonymously, are granted read-only access
 * to the application's public data collections (participants, payments, etc.). All write
 * operations (create, update, delete) are currently disabled by default because the data
 * models lack explicit ownership fields (e.g., 'creatorId' or 'ownerId'). This is a
 * critical security measure to prevent unauthorized data modification. To enable writes,
 * the corresponding data entities must be updated to include an ownership field, which can
 * then be validated in these rules.
 *
 * Data Structure: All application data is organized under the path `/artifacts/{appId}/public/data`,
 * where `{appId}` serves as a top-level namespace for a specific application instance. This
 * structure ensures that data for different application instances is cleanly segregated. Core
 * collections like 'participants', 'payments', and 'novedades' reside within this path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All access is denied by default.
 * - Authenticated Reads: Any user with a valid authentication token (request.auth != null),
 *   including anonymous users, can read data from any of the main collections.
 * - Writes Disabled: All write operations are explicitly set to `if false;`. This is a
 *   deliberate choice to enforce security until a clear ownership model is defined in the
 *   application's data schemas.
 * - No User Listing: There is no top-level `/users` collection, so listing users is not applicable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The data model is designed to be authorization-independent,
 * meaning documents do not require cross-document reads (`get()` calls) to determine access.
 * This ruleset relies on that principle, leading to simpler, more performant, and more secure rules.
 * For example, when write rules are eventually implemented, they will validate an ownership field
 * directly on the document being modified.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Data is segregated by collection under a common path, ensuring all
 * documents within a collection share the same security profile. This avoids mixing public and
 * private data and simplifies rules for list operations.
